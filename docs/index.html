    <p>
      Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task completion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience. 
      Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. 
      Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g. user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. 
      To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a <strong>Personal</strong>ized <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>gent <strong>B</strong>enchmark (<strong>PersonalWAB</strong>), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. 
      Moreover, we propose a <strong>P</strong>ersonalized <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>M</strong>emory-enhanced <strong>A</strong>lignment (<strong>PUMA</strong>) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. 
      Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. 
      Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.

  <div class="about">
    <p>
      Our benchmark includes: 
      <li> <strong>Personalized User Data</strong>: 1,000 diverse user profiles and 40,000+ web behaviors, originated from real-world data.</li>
      <li> <strong>User Instructions</strong>: 9,000+ personalized natural language instructions tailored to each user's profile.</li>
      <li> <strong>User Simulatior</strong>: Simulates interactions aligned with user profiles and historical behaviors.</li>
      <li> <strong>Evaluation Paradigms</strong>: Single-turn track tests for isolated tasks and multi-turn for more complex interactions.</li>
